## About

My name is Mikael Carlsson, I am 28 years old and I live in Alingsås, 50 km north of Gothenburg, Sweden.

In my whole life I have been interested in computers, tech and development. My greatest passion is web development. I can build websites, web applications and handle both front-end and back-end development.

Today I mainly work with HTML, CSS, JS for front-end and NodeJS for back-end, but in the past I also worked with PHP even if it's not my primary choice today.

When it comes to choosing platforms, I always promote Unix / Linux systems so it is an obvious choice for me to run Ubuntu or Debian based systems for clients and servers as well as Android for mobile devices.
Of course, MacOS and iOS are also included in my thoughts thanks to their base from Unix.

On my spare time when I don’t sit behind the computer I love to walk and train my dog and spending time with my fiancee.

I am a positive person who is very stubborn and tries to solve problems that may arise. With the ability to quickly take in new information and knowledge, I quickly learn new systems and tasks. I’m always willing to learn new things because I think the brain can never be full.
