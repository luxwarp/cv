## About

My name is Mikael Carlsson, I am 30 years old and I live in Svanesund, Orust, 50 km north of Gothenburg, Sweden.

In my whole life I have been interested in computers, tech and development. Today my greatest passion is web development, testing and working with new tech and also help the open source community with support, testing, bug fixing, and translation.

When it comes to choosing platforms, I always promote Unix / Linux systems so it's an obvious choice for me to run Ubuntu or Manjaro (based on Arch Linux) systems for clients servers as well as Android for mobile devices. Of course, MacOS and iOS are also included in my thoughts thanks to their base from Unix.

On my spare time when I don’t sit behind the computer I love to walk and train my dog.

I am a positive person who is very stubborn and tries to solve problems that may arise. With the ability to quickly take in new information and knowledge, I quickly learn new systems and tasks. I’m always willing to learn new things because I believe that the brain can never be full.
