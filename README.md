About 'Luxwarp'
===============================================================

My name is Mikael Carlsson, I am 29 years old and
I live in Alingsås, 50km north of Gothenburg, Sweden.

In my whole life I have been interested in computers,
tech and development. My greatest passion
is web development. I can build websites, web applications
and handle both front-end and back-end development.

On my spare time when I don’t sit behind the computer
I love to walk and train my dogs and spending
time with my fiancee.

I am a positive person who is very stubborn and
tries to solve problems that may arise. With the
ability to quickly take in new information and
knowledge, I quickly learn systems and tasks. I’m
always willing to learn new things because the
brain can not be full.
