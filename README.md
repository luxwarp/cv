## About

My name is Mikael Carlsson, I am 28 years old and I live in Alingsås, 50km north of Gothenburg, Sweden.

In my whole life I have been interested in computers, tech and development. My greatest passion is web development. I can build websites, web applications and handle both front-end and back-end development.

On my spare time when I don’t sit behind the computer I love to walk and train my dog and spending time with my girlfriend.

I am a positive person who is very stubborn and tries to solve problems that may arise. With the ability to quickly take in new information and knowledge, I quickly learn systems and tasks. I’m always willing to learn new things because the brain can not be full.
